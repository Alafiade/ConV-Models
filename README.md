Analysis of ConVolutional Nueral Network Models on a custom dataset
This repo contains various convolutional neural network architectures, focusing on their performance and efficiency using finetuning and transfer learnig techniques in image classification techniques. The models evaluated are:
DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network): Known for its dense connectivity pattern where each layer is connected to every other layer, enabling better feature reuse and efficient parameter utilization.
Vision Transformers: This model utilizes the transformer architecture originally designed for natural language processing tasks, adapting it for image processing through patch-based self-attention mechanisms.
