Analysis of ConVolutional Nueral Network Models on a custom dataset
This repo contains various convolutional neural network architectures, focusing on their performance and efficiency using finetuning and transfer learnig techniques in image classification techniques. The models evaluated are:

 ResNet(Residual Network): Known for its innovative use of skip connections, ResNet enables the training of very deep networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.

 Vision Transformers : This utilizes the transformer models used for natural language processing tasks.

 EfficientNet: Modifies optimizes both accuracy and efficiency usong the compund scaling method which balances network depth, width and resolution.
 This analysis provides insights on which model performs well on the custom dataset
